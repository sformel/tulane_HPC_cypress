## This repository is meant for all...

### Cypress is awesome
The Tulane University HPC (High-Performance Computing system), Cypress, is an awesome resource we have access to.  The admins do a great job running it and [their wiki](https://wiki.hpc.tulane.edu/trac/wiki/cypress/about) is a good place to start learning about it.


### But they can't cover everything

Many of use start using Cypress with little experience.  So I'm trying to create tutorials to help people navigate working on a remote computing grid.

### Please contribute!

There's a lot of knowledge floating around in the brainiacs at Tulane University.  You can contribute to this repository by:

#### Making corrections

***

If you find something incorrect, or that could be written more clearly, please comment on it/submit a revision.

#### Writing tutorials

***

Know any tools that might be helpful for general computing?  Write a tutorial.

Just made it through a frustrating ordeal to make something work?  Write a tutorial so others can get frustrated elsewhere.
