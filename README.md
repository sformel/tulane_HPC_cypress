## This repository is meant for all...

##### *Cypress is awesome*

The Tulane University HPC (High-Performance Computing system), Cypress, is an awesome resource we have access to.  The admins do a great job running it and [their wiki](https://wiki.hpc.tulane.edu/trac/wiki/cypress/about) is a good place to start learning about it.


##### *But they can't cover everything*

Many of use start using Cypress with little experience.  So I'm trying to create tutorials to help people navigate working on a remote computing grid.


## Please contribute!

There's a lot of knowledge floating around in the brainiacs at Tulane University.  You can contribute to this repository by:
